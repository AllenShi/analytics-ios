 The following two extern variables are disabled for now because Analytics.h can be used as static lib as well which would 
 not have the FOUNDATION_EXPORT variables be properly defined
//! Project version number for Analytics.
FOUNDATION_EXPORT double AnalyticsVersionNumber;

//! Project version string for Analytics.
FOUNDATION_EXPORT const unsigned char AnalyticsVersionString[];

// In this header, you should import all the public headers of your framework using statements like #import <Analytics/PublicHeader.h>
